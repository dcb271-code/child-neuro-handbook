24 hours, traumatic seizure, transient focal neurologic deficit or a GCS of 13-14.  </li><li>Diagnosis of acute concussion involves assessment of: </li><li>Mental status at time of injury or medical evaluation as noted above<ul><li>Symptoms typical of concussion in the following domains: somatic (e.g. headache, nausea), cognitive (e.g. inattention, poor concentration), emotional (e.g. sadness, irritability) and behavioral (e.g. lowered frustration tolerance).</li><li>CT and standard MRI imaging of the brain offer no additional information to the diagnosis of concussion but may be indicated to exclude more serious pathology.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Evaluation in Emergency Room or Office by Medical Personnel</strong></p><ul><li><ul><li>The features of this exam should encompass:</li><li>Thorough history: mechanism, associated symptoms, prior concussion history, LOC, presence of amnesia, seizures, neurologic complaints, medications </li><li>Assessment of mental status: GCS, orientation, perseveration, memory</li><li>GCS alone is insufficient as &gt;90% of patients will have GCS of 15</li><li>Neurologic exam: cranial nerves with particular attention to CN III, motor, coordination and reflexes</li><li>Determination of need for emergent neuro-imaging (CT scan)<ul><li>The Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network study of factors associated with a very low risk of clinically important TBI includes an algorithm to assist with the decision to obtain a CT scan.<a href=\"file:///Z:/Child%20Neurology%20Residency%20Program/Child%20Neuro%20Handbook/ChildNeurologyResidentSurvivalGuide_2019_FINAL.docx#_ENREF_1\"><sup>1</sup></a><sup> This is available free on PubMed.</sup></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Symptom Management in the Emergency Room or Office</strong></p><ul><li><ul><li>Analgesia: after health care provider evaluation, NSAIDs including ibuprofen and naproxen sodium are preferred for treatment of headache. There is no published evidence of increased bleeding risk with NSAIDs. Acetaminophen is also acceptable. Opioids should be strongly avoided. </li><li>Nausea/Vomiting: ondansetron may be considered and is generally considered safe.</li></ul></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Guiding Return-to-Play (RTP)</strong></p><ul><li><ul><li>Rest: a 1-2 day period of relative rest is recommended follow an acute concussion</li><li>Activities that exacerbate symptoms should be avoided</li><li>Light aerobic activity (e.g. walking) is acceptable if it does not exacerbate symptoms</li><li>Available evidence shows that <em>strict</em> rest (no TV, music, video games, texting, reading, school, activities out of the home, etc) has no benefit and may prolong the duration of post-concussive symptoms</li><li>RTP: once all symptoms at rest have resolved, young athletes should be guided through a graduated return-to-play protocol. An example is included below. </li><li>NOTE: All 50 US states have youth concussion legislation in place. These vary from state to state.</li><li>Colorado Youth Concussion Act: includes children 11-18 years old involved in any organized sport (school or club)</li><li>Must be removed from play if a concussion is <em>suspected</em><ul><li>Requires <em>written</em> clearance to RTP from a health care provider</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><ul><li><img src=\"/images/other-topics/img-5.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"max-w-full rounded-lg my-4 mx-auto block\"></li></ul></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><ul><li>The athlete should continue to proceed to the next level if asymptomatic at the current level. Each step should take 24 hours, so that an athlete would take approximately 1 week to proceed through the full rehabilitation protocol once asymptomatic at rest and with provocative exercise. If any post-concussion symptoms occur, then the patient should drop back to the previous asymptomatic level and try to progress again after a further 24-hour period. Symptoms persisting more than 2-3 weeks, unusual symptoms, development of new symptoms beyond 48 hours or a history of repeated concussion should prompt consideration of referral to a concussion specialist.<a href=\"file:///Z:/Child%20Neurology%20Residency%20Program/Child%20Neuro%20Handbook/ChildNeurologyResidentSurvivalGuide_2019_FINAL.docx#_ENREF_2\"><sup>2 </sup></a></li><li><strong><em>Children should not be returned to practice or play until clinically completely symptom free and never on the same day as the injury performance.</em></strong><a href=\"file:///Z:/Child%20Neurology%20Residency%20Program/Child%20Neuro%20Handbook/ChildNeurologyResidentSurvivalGuide_2019_FINAL.docx#_ENREF_2\"><strong><em><sup>2</sup></em></strong></a></li><li><strong><em>Children should not return to sports until they have successfully returned to the classroom.</em></strong><a href=\"file:///Z:/Child%20Neurology%20Residency%20Program/Child%20Neuro%20Handbook/ChildNeurologyResidentSurvivalGuide_2019_FINAL.docx#_ENREF_2\"><strong><em><sup>2</sup></em></strong></a></li></ul></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Guiding Return to School</strong></p><ul><li><ul><li>Rationale: Children may require assistance with returning to school. Often symptoms such as poor attention and concentration, headaches, phono/photophobia and lowered frustration tolerance can interfere with learning. Conversely, cognitive exertion may exacerbate symptoms. There is little evidence to support any specific recommendation. Refer to the AAP Clinical Report on return to learing after concussion.<a href=\"file:///Z:/Child%20Neurology%20Residency%20Program/Child%20Neuro%20Handbook/ChildNeurologyResidentSurvivalGuide_2019_FINAL.docx#_ENREF_3\"><sup>3</sup></a></li><li>The “return-to-learn” team: Especially for children with severe or prolonged symptoms, a team approach to re-entering the classroom is ideal. The team consists of the patient, parent, health care providers, teachers and school administrators. Children may require the assistance of a neuropsychologist to determine whether difficulties are related to the neurologic sequelae of physiologic injury or psychologic problems.</li><li>Timing: most children can return to the classroom within 1-2 days</li><li>Workload: <ul><li>In-class time may require reduction with ½ days or more frequent breaks</li><li>Homework may also require reduction in volume or delayed deadlines for completing assignments</li><li>Testing may need to be delayed and major tests such as final exams and college entrance exams rescheduled if possible</li><li><strong>Recovery</strong></li></ul></li><li>Studies in various populations of children suggest that most children (&gt;80%) will recover from a concussion within 1-2 weeks with no long term cognitive impairment or persistent symptoms. Symptoms lasting more than 3 months are very unusual. </li><li>Symptoms lasting more than 2 weeks, especially severe symptoms, or atypical symptoms should prompt consideration of referral to a specialist in concussion care.</li><li>Sleep: sleep is often disrupted after concussion. Children should be encouraged to get appropriate amounts of sleep for age, practice proper sleep hygiene and avoid stimulants (e.g. caffeine) if possible. </li></ul></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1.
